// STEPS
// FIRST: Test all of the selectors above

// Get the textContent from the <h1>

// Put some textContent into the .h1-copy

// Apply opacity 0 to the .h1-copy

// Apply opacity 1 to the .h1-copy

// A) Determine the scrollY of the window when the element is scrolled out of view
// B) Determine how this would be done by looking at the "Properties of the h1"

// if (heading is "in view") by checking how much has scrolled

// else (heading is NOT "in view") by checking how much has scrolled

// Capture the 'scroll' of the window
